      "summary": "A 1513 Ottoman map fragment by Admiral Piri Reis showing the Atlantic Ocean, parts of South America, and portions of the African coast. The map has been the subject of fringe theories claiming it shows Antarctica's ice-free coastline, but mainstream cartographic scholarship has thoroughly explained its contents as depicting the South American coast using earlier source maps.",
      "full": "The Piri Reis map is a world map fragment compiled in 1513 by Ottoman admiral and cartographer Ahmed Muhiddin Piri, known as Piri Reis. Drawn on gazelle skin, the surviving fragment shows the western coasts of Europe and North Africa and the coast of Brazil with reasonable accuracy. The map became controversial in the 20th century when fringe theorists claimed it depicted Antarctica's coastline before it was covered by ice, suggesting advanced ancient civilizations or alien knowledge. However, academic cartographers and historians have thoroughly analyzed the map and concluded it shows the South American coast, not Antarctica. The map is an important historical document demonstrating Ottoman cartographic knowledge in the Age of Discovery, but presents no genuine mystery per mainstream scholarship."
